## Below are two functions that are used to create a special object that stores a numeric matrix and caches its inverse.

##  The following function "makeCacheMatrix" creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(Solve) m <<- Solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
  

}

## The following function "cacheSolve" computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  
    m <- x$getmean()
    if(!is.null(m)) {
      message("getting cached data")
      return(m)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    m <- Solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(m)
    m
}
